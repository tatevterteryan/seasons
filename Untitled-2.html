                <span>Autumn is the season after summer and before winter. In the United States this season is also called fall. 
                    In the Northern Hemisphere, it is often said to begin with the autumnal equinox in September and end with the winter solstice in December.
                     In the Southern Hemisphere, it runs from the autumnal equinox in March to the winter solstice in June.
                    In many places in the temperate zone, autumn is a time for harvesting most crops.
                     Deciduous trees (trees that lose their leaves every year) lose their leaves, usually after turning yellow, red, or brown. In many countries, autumn is the time a new school year starts. The period of school between the start of September and the end of December is often referred to as the Fall Semester, Fall Quarter, or Fall Term. </span>

                <span>Winter is one of the four Earth’s seasons, that goes after autumn and foreshadows spring. This season is the coldest in the whole year, but not in the tropical zones.
                     Everyone feels some magic in the air, because of frosts, crystal nights, snow and just this amazing atmosphere.
                    This time of the year is perfect for doing winter sport activities, such as snowboarding, ski riding, ice skating, playing snowballs and much more. Winter is also a perfect time to be at home, drink hot tea or coffee, spend time with family, friends, watch movies and just enjoy every day! </span>

                <span>Spring is the season after winter and before summer. Days become longer and weather gets warmer in the temperate zone because the Earth tilts relative to its orbital plane around the Sun.
                     In many parts of the world it rains for hours. This helps the plants grow and flowers bloom. Often people with hay fever suffer more,
                      because some plant pollens are allergens. Many animals have their breeding seasons in spring.
                       At the start of spring, people suffering from seasonal affective disorder will feel better. The vernal equinox in springtime makes days and nights equally long in the temperate zone.Holidays celebrated in spring include Passover and Easter. In many countries, the period of school between early January and later May or early June is referred to as the “Spring Semester” or “Spring Term”.
                     Spring break is a vacation period in early spring at universities and schools in various countries in the world. </span>

                <span>Summer, warmest season of the year, between spring and autumn. In the Northern Hemisphere, it is usually defined as
                     the period between the summer solstice (year’s longest day), June 21 or 22, and the autumnal equinox (day and night equal in length), September 22 or 23; and in the Southern Hemisphere, as the period between December 22 or 23 and March 20 or 21. The temperature contrast between summer and the other
                     seasons exists only in middle and high latitudes; temperatures in the equatorial regions
                      generally vary little from month to month. For physical causes of the seasons, see season. </span>
